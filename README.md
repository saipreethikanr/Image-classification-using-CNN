# üß† Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on CIFAR-10

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end image classification pipeline using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. It compares CNNs with traditional **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to highlight the superior performance of CNNs in handling complex image data.

The goal is to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models to accurately classify images into one of 10 categories.

## üß† Model Architecture (CNN)

Typical CNN architecture used in this project includes:

- **Convolutional Layers** (`Conv2D`)  
  Extract spatial features using multiple filters.

- **Activation Functions** (`ReLU`)  
  Introduce non-linearity.

- **Pooling Layers** (`MaxPooling2D`)  
  Downsample the feature maps to reduce complexity.

- **Flatten Layer**  
  Convert 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.

- **Dense Layers**  
  Fully connected layers for classification.

- **Output Layer**  
  `Softmax` activation for multiclass probability output.
